The solution involves a thorough check of Android build environment settings and dependencies. First, verify that all Android SDK components required by your project are installed and properly configured (check the Expo documentation). Second, carefully examine your package.json for any conflicting or outdated dependencies, especially those related to Android. Use `expo prebuild` to check for potential errors before starting the build.  If the issue persists, consider creating a clean project to rule out project-specific issues and systematically add components to identify the problem dependency.  Finally, ensure your system meets the minimum requirements specified in the Expo documentation.
